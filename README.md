# Matrix-Operations-with-File-i-o

Within this repository lies a program implemented to perform matrix operations on n-dimensonal square and non-square matrices. Most of these operations are elementary, e.g., Gaussian elimination, backwards substitution, A<sup>2</sup> (A = nxn), etcetera; nonetheless, this implementation will be updated with more advanced linear operations in the future.

There is also a selection of files dedicated to file i/o and data input and output.
